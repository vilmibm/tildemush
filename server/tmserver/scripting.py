# TODO
# (every) macro
# 
# this macro is invoked like:
# (every (random-number)
#   (does "dances"))
# 
# when compiled, a helper (add-scheduled-callback) is called.
# this helper is responsible for storing a row via the ScheduledCallback model as well as storing
# the callback in memory with a generated callback_id.
# if add-scheduled-callback sees that a row exists such that:
# - the revision ID matches the current object revision
# - the hash of the callback matches the current callback's hash
# then it does nothing
#
# the row is something like:
# - last_run timestamp
# - callback_id
# - callback hash
# - object id
# - interval in minutes
# - revision_id
# 
# a scheduler loop runs every minute, looking for rows such that:
#
# last_run + interval <= now
#
# the scheduler then does some stuff.
# - grabs the associated object
# - compiles the witch code
# - runs the callback ID'd by callback_id
#
# questsions / scenarios
#
# - what happens when the server restarts?
#   - nothing, really. the scheduler is started and acts as normal. there will be a thundering herd
#     of unrun tasks at first which might end up being a problem, but i can worry about that later;
#     one tactic is to just set last_run to be the moment the scheduler starts.

# - what about variable intervals?
#  - this is hard to support since it means also supporting a reference to arbitrary code that will
#    evaluate into an interval and re-running it each time the job runs. for the intial support of
#    (every) i'm more comfortable supporting a compile time interval. a hacky way to support this
#    could be having (every) report what the *next* interval is every time it is evaluated but i
#    don't want to depend on that.

# - how will callback hashing work?
#  - I don't ever want a hash across the whole (incantation) as the data section doesn't correspond
#    to revisions. i think i want a hash of everything in (every...). MD5 is what i'd usually use. i'm
#    concerned about a higher collision rate for smaller strings but until that starts happening i
#    want to use something very standard.

# - should hash just be the callback id?
#  - this is kind of instinct but i'm thinking no. ID can be UUID and hash is a seperate concept.

# - how does the scheduler run?
#  - can use the async loop or just run a loop in a thread. for conceptual simplicity i think i'll
#    just use async. in general i want to be taking better advantage of async stuff anyway.

# - are you going to end up leaking memory like crazy as objects with scheduled tasks get reified
#   every minute?
#   - probably ugh i'd like to audit the GameObject lifecycle.
#   - i'll need to study RAM usage over time to really understand it, but right now there shouldn't
#     be risk to constantly re-evaluate the WITCH code. it's already happening pretty much every time
#     anything happens on the server (probably causing a lot of the latency) and when i optimize it
#     it'll optimize for (every) usage as well as regular action dispatching.
#
# - how are tasks stopped?
#   - by deleting them from the WITCH code. upon compilation, after registering callbacks for the
#     current revision all rows for any older revision are deleted.
#
# development plan
#
# - [x] add model
# - [x] write the add_scheduled_action helper
# - [x] add (every) macro
# - [ ] add scheduler loop
# - [ ] add server start-up behavior (setting last run)
# - [ ] implement and test (every) hashing
# - [ ] tie is all together as needed
